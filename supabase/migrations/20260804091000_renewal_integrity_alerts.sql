-- Integrity alerts for the renewal cycle — make the silent failures visible.
--
-- WHY (deal 005014, 2026-08-04): the card stayed in Done for a paid cycle and
-- nothing anywhere said so. The renewal chain fails quietly by design — every
-- guard is a WHERE clause, so "did not match" and "nothing to do" look the same.
-- 20260804090000 fixes the guard; these three checks make the remaining failure
-- modes surface in the accounting Alerts panel the same day.
--
--   21 seo_renewal_pending   — a paid cycle is ahead of the card's renewal
--      ledger and the card is not in Renewal. After 20260804090000 this can only
--      mean the move itself failed (client_blocked, missing renewal lane,
--      trigger disabled during maintenance). Signature = the period, so
--      dismissing one cycle does not hide the next.
--   22 seo_job_no_period     — the client has paid on this deal but the SEO job
--      has no billing period at all: recompute_job_period_dates matches a
--      payment to a job on service_type AND billing_type, so one mis-keyed
--      payment leaves the job with NULL dates and every downstream guard
--      (renewal, due chips, reminders) silently no-ops.
--   23 paid_period_no_job    — the mirror image, seen from the payment: a paid
--      period whose service_type matches no live job on the deal.
--
-- Base body: live 2026-08-04 pg_get_functiondef, md5 61edf2a71300090e3ea8eac3c9e3998f,
-- byte-identical to the repo emission in 20260728120000_domains_service.sql
-- (drift-checked before editing). Checks 1-20 are unchanged; 21-23 appended.
--
-- APPLIED to prod 2026-08-04, post-change md5 d5a886e95dfeb92673258d035cd6a818.
--   First run: 21 -> 0 rows, 22 -> 4 rows (live active SEO cards billed under a
--   different service on the deal, so they can never renew), 23 -> 0 rows.
--
-- ROLLBACK: re-apply the accounting_integrity_alerts body from
--   20260728120000_domains_service.sql (md5 above).
